// fifty percent but remains under eighty, and the air pressure is steady, then the 
// senior technician John, who has at least three years of work experience in 
// networking and servers administration should be notified, and he must wake up in 
// the middle of the night, dress up, go out, take his car or call a cab if he does 
// not have a car, drive to the office, enter the building, start the air conditioning 
// and wait until temperature raises over ten degrees and humidity falls below twenty
